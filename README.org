* Glove-colorizer

Glove-colorizer is an attempt to change colors of the glove depending on the currently playng song.

** Requirements:
- Python 3.6
- bash

** Usage:

```shell
bash doh.sh
```

Curretly, it's total garbage, the same effect can be achieved by using the following snippet:

```shell
while true; do
    echo \#$(head -c 256 /dev/urandom | md5sum | cut -c 1-6)
    sleep 1
done | glava --stdin
```
